# Fitting_Model

This project shows how to fit a polynomial model to the data. There are three steps followed in the code procedure:


(1) identifying an optimal degree for the polynomial using the validation set.

(2) fit the model (with selected degree) using the training and validation data and print the training and test errors.

(3) plot the polynomial function that was fitted.
